# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-of-t-test-Robustness
This GitHub project investigates the robustness of the t-test to departures from normality by examining its empirical Type I error rate under three non-normal distributions. The project demonstrates statistical simulation skills in R and provides insights into when the t-test can be reliably used.
